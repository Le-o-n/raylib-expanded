Sound Manager
    - Hashmap to store the sounds x
    - Sound struct for wrapping the raylib sounds
      - delete needs to call raylibs sound unload
      - init should have path passed
      - init func will init the raylib sound struct
    - an asset/sounds folder

    - auto python creation of defines
        - sub folders are preprended to name
