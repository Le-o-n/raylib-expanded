====== Now ===========
Sound Manager

    - Sound struct for wrapping the raylib sounds
      - delete needs to call raylibs sound unload
      - init should have path passed
      - init func will init the raylib sound struct
    - an asset/sounds folder
    - soundmanager just needs a path to the asset dir then recursively saerches
    - auto python creation of defines
        - sub folders are preprended to name
